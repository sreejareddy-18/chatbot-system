# Chatbot
Overview:
This project involves the development of a cloud-based web application designed as a chatbot for students. The system utilizes artificial intelligence to understand and respond to student queries related to college activities. It allows students to interact with the chatbot in a natural, conversational manner, without requiring any specific format or keywords.

Functionality:
The chatbot uses AI algorithms to interpret and respond to student questions accurately, simulating a human-like conversation experience through an intuitive graphical user interface.Students can inquire about various college-related matters online without needing to visit the campus physically.If a user receives an incorrect or irrelevant answer, they can flag the response as invalid by clicking the “Invalid Answer” button.These flagged responses are sent to the admin panel, where the administrator can log in to review them.The admin has the option to either delete the invalid answer or provide a corrected response for future reference.The chatbot continually improves based on feedback, enhancing the accuracy of its answers over time.The system ensures that students stay informed about college events, updates, and information through this easy-to-use platform.

Cloud Deployment:
To ensure scalability and accessibility, the entire application is deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS, GCP, or Heroku. This enables 24/7 availability and real-time updates, making the chatbot a reliable source of information for students.
